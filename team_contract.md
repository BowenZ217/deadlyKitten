# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

Our team will meet once a week every Thursday from 7-8 PM after lab in person. Every week someone will be designated to take notes on a google doc. These notes will be used to track our progress as well as be a reference for the DEVELOPMENT LOG entry.

2. **Assistance** 

We will be using both email and discord as our forms of communication. Replies should be within 48hrs in order to increase collaboration. However, under uncontrollable circumstances/emergencies, replies after 48hrs are acceptable.

3. **Respect** 

At the start of every meeting, we will go around in a circle and ensure that everyone can express their ideas. We will each try to give feedback in order to promote active listening and discussion. Big decisions will be determined via majority vote.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

We will try our best to equally distribute the workload. In situations where there are bigger takss, we will ensure that two people are assigned to that workload instead of just one. We can message in the Discord if the workload is ever to much, and do our best to accomadate/readjust workload.

5. **Time Commitment** 

Each person should be expected to work on average 4 hours/week. This isn't a hard set number, as the most important thing would be do complete your assigned workload. If someone doesn't have time during a specific week, that person spends extra time the next week. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

 All conflicts within the team will be resolved in a professional manner. Disagreements will be resolved by vote. If a certain group member is habitually completing less work than expected or late we will have a discussion with said member in order to resolve any issues. If this is not enough, worst comes to worst we will inform course staff, but only after we try to solve the conflict ourselves. Other hypothetical situations will be dealt with when they arise, and we will try our best to be fair to all group members.
