# Your Goals

The goals of the our projct are to increase profits for an airline company by setting up routes to major airports around the world, and to find the shortest routes that could pass through these important airports and return to the starting point. 

We'are using OpenFlight as our dataset. And these goals will be achieved by calculating the distances between airports using latitude and longitude, and finding the shortest paths using Dijkstras and FloydWarshall algorithm. Based on the shortest paths, we can further calculate the centrality of airports.



# Conclusions

quantitative results



Currently, we have found the shortest path between multiple central airports using a greedy algorithm, which finds the local solution at each iteration between two airports by shortest path algorithm. This method does not guarantee a global optimal solution. If we had more time, we would likely implement a genetic algorithm to find the global optimal solution for the leading question.

Of course, In this team project, we learned a lot about working together to achieve a common goal. We enjoyed coding as a part of a team, collaborating with team members and sharing ideas to come up with creative solutions to the challenges. One thing I liked about the team work was the diversity of perspectives and skills that everyone brought to the work. Overall, we found the team work experiences to be valuable and educational, from which we learned lots of new knowledges and techniques.
