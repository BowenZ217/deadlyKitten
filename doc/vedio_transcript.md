# Your Goals

The goals of the our projct are to increase profits for an airline company by setting up routes to major airports around the world, and to find the shortest routes that could pass through these important airports and return to the starting point. 

We'are using OpenFlight as our dataset. And these goals will be achieved by calculating the distances between airports using latitude and longitude, and finding the shortest paths using Dijkstras and FloydWarshall algorithm. Based on the shortest paths, we can further calculate the centrality of airports.
